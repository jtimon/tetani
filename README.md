# Tetani Bioinspired Rust Library

Tetani aims to be a library written in Rust and implementing several
bioinspired algorithms such as neural networks, genetic algorithms or
cellular automata.

The name was inspired by [Clostridium tetani], bacterium causative of
[tetanus] that can live, among other places, in rust.

This starts as a pet project to learn the Rust language and probably
nobody will want to depend on it for their own projects. But, who
knows? Perhaps some day in the future most people playing with Rust will
get Tetani.

Tetani shamelessly intends to copy from [PREANN], which implements
neural networks trained with genetic algorithms in C++ with some
parts optimized for SIMD and GPGPU. But it's unmaintained, outdated
and documented mostly in Spanish.
